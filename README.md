# 🚀 Fast Filtering with Large Option Panels: Implications for Asset Pricing

Welcome to the repository for **"Fast Filtering with Large Option Panels: Implications for Asset Pricing"**. This project introduces a computationally efficient particle MCMC framework to analyze large option datasets, tackling challenges in dynamic option pricing and asset valuation.

## ✨ Key Features

- 📊 **Dynamic Models**: Implementation of models like Heston's square root and Duffie-Pan-Singleton double-jump models.
- 🔧 **Particle Filtering**: Optimized filtering using particle weights based on quantiles.
- 📈 **Empirical Analysis**: Results derived from extensive datasets (S&P500 returns and options).

## 🛠️ Built With

- **NumPy** 🧮
- **SciPy** 🔬
- **Matplotlib** 📊
- **Particles** 🎲

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
